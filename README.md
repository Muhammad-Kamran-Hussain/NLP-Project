📰 Multilingual News Video Analysis
This repository contains a Python application designed for analyzing news videos using advanced NLP techniques. The project extracts speech from videos, transcribes it, translates to English (if needed), detects topics, and performs sentiment analysis using both rule-based and transformer-based methods.

🚀 Features
Video-to-Audio Conversion: Converts news videos into audio files using FFmpeg.

Speech-to-Text (Transcription): Transcribes speech using the Faster Whisper model.

Language Detection & Translation: Automatically detects the spoken language and translates to English if necessary.

Topic Modeling: Identifies main topics from transcripts using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

Sentiment Analysis:

VADER for rule-based sentiment scoring.

Transformer model (nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) for deep learning sentiment prediction.

Overall Summary: Aggregates sentiment across multiple videos to determine the general tone of the day’s news.
